# Personal Neo-Vim setup

The main purpose of having a **strong** Neo-Vim setup is to never have to take my hands off of the keyboard during development. 

## Plugins

### Colorscheme (Cyberdream)

I think this one is still likely to change. I definitley do not hate it, but will likely want to update my terminal and then find a colorscheme that best works with it.

### Commenter

Just a simple plugin to make commenting lines easier in vim

### Harpoon

This is from Primeagen, and I think is a very nice way to navigate between files quickly. Especially since it is so customizable and can update based on when you are working on different sections. Although, I am curious to find out if I can set "loadouts" so that if I am working with a lot of files, I can change my harpoon loadouts. This would be very convenient specifically for professional work. If I make large enough projects, it will be nice at home as well. But as for now, my projects are not large enough, and I can fit all of my files within the 4 defined harpoon keybinds I have set. 

### Language Server Protocol (LSP)

During my time in school, I used JetBrains for some of my classes. The tools it has available to the user are incredible. Having these in vim are also incredibly convenient.

### LuaLine

Just a nice and simple plugin that provides useful information on the status line at the bottom of a Neo-Vim editing environment

### Telescope (fuzzy finder)

Very useful for finding files. It has grep search-ability, but I have not had much luck with that. But, with my next plugin, I don't have much of a problem with this being broken.

### ToggleTerm

The ability to use a terminal and hide it with simple commands was a must. Having the ability to build my code without having to exit the editor was a must have for me. It also just gives me general functionality like grep without needing an additional plugin.

### TreeSitter

Not even really sure what this is supposed to do. I know it helps with syntax highlighting, so maybe I just accept that. \*shrugs\*
